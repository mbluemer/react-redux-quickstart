# React-Redux Quickstart
This repo contains a basic quickstart for building react-redux applications. This quickstart uses Yarn, Gulp, Babel, EsLint, Webpack, Mocha, and Chai.

In order to start just clone the repo and then run:
```
yarn
```

## Future Plans
Currently set up for just the front end so you have to open up the index.html file in the dist directory to view the app. Plans to add Express soon, my brain is just fried for today.

This is me working on learning React-Redux currently. As I learn other stacks I plan to turn this repo into a more general quickstart repo.


## Credits
Thanks to [Jonathan Verrecchia](https://github.com/verekia) for making [this](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch) awesome guide on building a javascript stack from scratch. The initial commit is pretty much just me following the guide.
